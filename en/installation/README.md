# Start reading

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [How the internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [Introduction to the command line](../intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Introduction to Python](../python_introduction/README.md)


# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to [Your first Bottle project!](../bottle_start_project/README.md) because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
