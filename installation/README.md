# Installation
In this class you will be building a blog, and there are a few setup tasks in the tutorial which would be good to work through beforehand so that you are ready.  You can choose to develop on any platform you like, and there are some pretty good instructions for Windows, Mac and Linux.  All the book examples will be based on a cloud environment,  since that is browser based, it should look the same on all platforms.

# Start reading

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [How the internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [Introduction to the command line](../intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Introduction to Python](../python_introduction/README.md)


# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to [Your first Bottle project!](../bottle_start_project/README.md) because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
